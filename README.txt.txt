Assignment 5 README

1) I am using a Windows 11 System and started by configuring and generating the assignment files with CMake.
   I then was able to use Visual Studio to compile and build the code and then use PowerShell to run the code.

2) I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

3) I only referenced the lecture slides for all the computation info.

4) I had no lingering issues

5) I did not do any of the extra credit.

6) This assignment was pretty fun and interesting. It did not take as much time as the other ones.
